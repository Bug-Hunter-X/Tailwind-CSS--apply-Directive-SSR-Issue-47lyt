This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR).  The issue arises when attempting to use Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a component that's rendered on the server.  The `@apply` directive relies on Tailwind's JIT compiler to inject the CSS classes at build time, but during SSR, the build process might not have completed, leading to missing styles. This results in the component not rendering with the expected styles on the initial load, though the styles might appear after the client-side hydration.
